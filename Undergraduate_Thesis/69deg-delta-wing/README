69-Degree Delta Wing Body

Update

Late June 2013, a new set of geometry and unstructed grids was
released. Make sure that the word 'split' is in the filename of
the geometry and unstructured grid file you use.

Simulation Conditions

- Euler
- 1.7 Mach number
- zero degrees angle of attack and sideslip

Data Summittal

data-submittal: contains the signature locations, template, and a Tecplot macro 
to extract signatures from volume data.

Geometry

geometry: contains the geometry of the model and sting in mulitple
formats

Grids

mixed-element: tetrahedra and prism element grids in mulitple formats
and resolutions

tetrahedral: purely tetrahedra grids converted from mixed-element grids

usm3d: purely tetrahedra grids converted to VGRID cogsg format

structured: point-matched stuctured block grids

surface: surface grid
