JAXA Wing Body

Simulation Conditions

1.6 Mach
0.0 (degree) angle of attack (geometry and grid provided includes rotation)
32.8 (m^2) reference area for half span model
38.7  (m) body length
U.S. Standard Atmosphere (1976)
15760 (m) altitude
216.65 (K) temperature

Optional:
5.70e+06 flight Reynolds Number per meter (for viscous simulation)
1.32e+05 wind tunnel Reynolds Number per meter (for viscous simulation)

The geometry and grid provided includes a rotation about the nose of
2.3067 deg to include design angle of attack. The units of the grid and
geometry are provided in meters.

Use the reference area to compute CL and CD. Use the nose (0,0,0) as
the refence center for CM and the body length as the moment reference length.

For optional loudness calculation, the minimum sampling frequency is 48 kHz
