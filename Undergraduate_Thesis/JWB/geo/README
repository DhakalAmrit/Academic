JAXA Wing Body Geometry

jwb-geom-v2-mm.stp:

 The geometry provided includes a rotation about the nose of 2.3067 deg
 to include the design angle of attack. The STEP file is in
 millimeters. It should be scaled on import to your grid generation
 system by 0.001 to yield meters. The model has a 38.7 (m) body
 length and a full span 65.6 (m^2) reference area.

 The model was provided by JAXA as separate wing and body parts. Scott
 Brynildsen combined the wing and body parts into a single solid
 model. It has been rotated in UG NX and exported it as AP-203 STEP
 in mm.

 The v1 version of this file was oriented incorrectly by rotating the
 configuration nose down, instead of nose up. The v2 version of the file
 superceedes the version v1 of the step file.

To validate:

 The nose is expected to be at (0,0,0) the upper aft centerline of
 the fuselage is expected to be at (38.6505,0,-1.3517) and the lower
 aft centerline of fuselage is expected to be at (38.6495,0,-1.3772)
 in meters.
